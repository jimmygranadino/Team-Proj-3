How do I push to the Master branch?
git push origin master - then do a pull request (then yell at Nesso)


How do I get up to date with the Master?

git pull upstream master



I am having issues with git pulling?!?! HALP

Git stash

- this will stash the commits on your pc if you are just pulling

Then use the 

git pull upstream master
